Keeping track of your progress is always hard, mostly because yo do not always progress in a straight line, there are many times in which you have to take a step back in order to take two steps forward. And sharing my progress in this platform might help me to see in which areas I have improved and in which ones I should put some extra effort. 

Setting your goals high is important to be someone succesful. And you must keep in mind that it takes time to be the best version of yourself, nonetheless you should not give up. I've always been someone with a mentality like this. I am not perfect, I make mistakes, but I always make sure to learn something from any outcome.

Welcome to my blog, my name is Bastian, I'm a junior software engineer and I hope that you enjoy whatever I post here. :)
