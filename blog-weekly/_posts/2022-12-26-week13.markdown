The first impression that you give to someone is something that they will never forget. It is important to try and give the best first impression that you can, although there will be sometimes that you will not be able to control what someone thinks about you the first time they meet you. When you want to get hired at a job that you desire, the first impression that they will have of you will be your CV, so it is really important to make it remarkable.

There are a few steps to follow in order to make a remarkable CV. First, you must give a brief introduction about yourself. You must be original and "sell youself", meaning that you must give the recruiter a reason to hire you. You have to take into account that each recruiter reads a lot of CVs per day, so in order to stand out, yours must be different. It must be brief but concise, nowadays everyone is in a hurry, so try to go straight to the point. 

Now that you have introduced yourself, you must talk about the skills that you have. Nowadays both soft and technical skills have the same importance. You can have the best technical skills for the position, but if you do not know how to communicate properly, or you are not a good teammate, you are of no use to the company.
