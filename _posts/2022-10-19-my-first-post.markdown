Knowing how to work as a team is probably one of the most important aspects of working on a project. Even though you feel that you could complete all tasks on your own, we must understand that we are not working alone, that it is important to work as a unit to provide the best outcome of the project to the client, or to whoever we are doing the project for. 

This week was focused on teamwork. We had a workshop in which we, in a simple way, designed a simple project that solved some problematics that we identified based on some client (another teammate) requirements. As a unit, we analyzed the information that was provided to us, and from that point up to the end of the workshop, we collectively designed what we thought was the best solution for our fictional client.  

When the week started, we were given some code-related tasks that we would have to complete during the next two weeks. Some of these tasks had to be solved by the whole apprentice team (without the staff). So, to complete these, we organized and scheduled a few meetings to plan out what we were going to do as a team. We shared our opinions and ideas, and together we found solutions to these problems as well. First, we had to plan the logical flow of the program, commonly known as an algorithm. After that, we all said which programming language we were most comfortable in. So, we started coding the exercises in the programming language that we chose.  

Another task that I started is a blog. For this project, I will be using GitHub pages, which will host my personal website directly from a GitHub repository. For this, I will also use ‘Jekyll’, which is a static site generator, which eases the process of uploading, and manipulating, the posts themselves.  

I really like working as a team, I have so much to learn from others, and I believe these said others have a lot to learn from me. Personal growth is based on your thoughts, your convictions and the people that surround you. The secret is to always give your best, no matter what, to succeed in what you are doing.
