This week was not as laborious as the previous ones. By Wednesday we were assgined a new project. This project is about creating a simple "to-do" app. It consists of coding the backend (API) using java and spring framework, and coding the frontend using React framework. I previously have made a few projects with Spring framework, so I know my ways around it, but regarding React I do not have any experience at all, and to be honest I am really excited to getting to learn and to work with this tool.

For the project, we were given functional requirements, engineering requirements and UX/UI requirements. Each of these described a part of the project, for example for the UX/UI components we were given the app's wireframe, which gives us an idea of how should the app look. For the engineering requirements we were given the set of requests that the API must handle. For now, the app does not have a database, but we must code it in a way that it is not difficult to implement it.

I am looking forward to work with these technologies and working on this project. I believe that I can learn a lot from it and I am sure that it is going to be an amazing experience.
